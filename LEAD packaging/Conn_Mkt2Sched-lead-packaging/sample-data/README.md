# Data management

Due to VCS policy and size restrictions, sample data are not uploaded to the repository. Instead they are shared through other channels.

A `.gitignore` file makes sure that anything placed in this folder will be ignored by the VCS.

The examples place on the [README.md](../README.md) are based on the assumption that in this folder there will be two directories (`input`. `output`) that will contain the corresponding data.
